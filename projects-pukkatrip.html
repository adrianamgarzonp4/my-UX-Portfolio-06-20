                <h2>Project overview</h2>
                <h3 class="h2-h3-po">Summary</h3>
                <p>Through qualitative and quantitative user research, I discovered that travelers have a difficult time finding information about local experiences available at their desired destinations. This reality causes them to miss authentic experiences and to waste time and money once they are at their destination.</p>
                <p>PukkaTrip is a travel app prototype designed to alleviate the described pain point by helping travelers discover authentic local experiences.</p>
                <a href="http://" class="in-text-link">Take a look at this case study storyboard here.</a>
                <h3>Project Goals</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncover travelers’ pain points in their trip planning process (when traveling for vacation)</li>
                    <li>Implement a user-centered design methodology to prototype a mobile travel app that addresses those pain points</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>My Role & Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Sole UX and UI designer</p>
                <h3>Timeline </h3>
                <p>4 weeks</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Pen & paper, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Miro & Procreate</p>
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p class="p-gb">I approached this problem from a place of curiosity. That curiosity turned into empathy as I interviewed users. Once I understood their main pain points, I narrowed the scope of the problem by defining a user persona and scenario. As a next step, I ideated potential solutions, prioritized, designed, and tested the user flow and visual design a couple of times. Based on the user feedback, I revised my wireframes and prototyped a minimum valuable product that addressed the users' pain points and stood out from the competition.</p>

            </div>
            <p>To learn more about how travelers plan their trips, I performed 5 interviews and 23 surveys.</p>
            <h3>Questions asked</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When traveling for vacation, what are some of the reasons why you do it?</li>
                <li>How do you go about planning a trip?</li>
                <li>What is the most time-consuming part about planning a vacation trip?</li>
                <li>What are the most time-consuming activities at your destination?</li>

                    <h3 class="h3-gbox">A challenge</h3>
                    <p>At this point in the ideation process, I realized that integrating a poll feature that allows users to post questions and receive individualized responses would address the user’s pain points and make it stand out from competitors.</p>
                    <p>However, a poll feature requires users to engage with the app by responding to other travelers’ polls, which makes the functionality sustainable and keeps the information authentic. Answering to other users' questions is a big ask that could deter some potential users from using the app.</p>
                    <p>To move forward, I took a close look at the user persona and concluded that a poll feature would be well adopted by my user based on the following assumptions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="side-60">
                    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The user is a traveler who plans ahead and enjoys discovering and connecting with others</li>
                        <li>The user is willing to take extra steps to make sure he gets the information he needs to maximize his travel experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Important considerations for the adoption of the poll feature</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The user will be shown previous poll responses and other users’ contributions before committing to submit a poll</li>
                        <li>After sending a poll the user will be invited to, not required to, reply to a fellow traveler's poll</li>
                        <li>Replying to a poll has to be as effortless as possible. Language in the request should be carefully crafted to incentivize its use and boost user’s buy-in</li>

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>User flow diagram</h3>
            <p>Once I decided to commit to including a poll feature, I began defining the user flow.</p>
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining a critical path that allowed the user to browse through locals’ and travelers’ recommendations</li>
                <li>Allowing the user to submit a poll to get current and individualized answers to his questions and review poll responses</li>
                <li>Figuring out a way to keep the community sustainable by encouraging users to provide authentic information to other users</li>
                <li>Reducing friction at entry-point
                    <p><em>Note:</em> This user flow incorporates the task of creating an account to submit a poll. Although it can be off-putting for some users, we are assuming that our user does most of his planning on his own and way in advance. Therefore, he is used to creating accounts to manage and keep track of the information he needs for his trip. There will be wording clarifying the convenience of creating an account on the screen.</p>

                <h2>The second round of usability testing: Making sure that the prototype works as intended</h2>
            </div>
            <p>To test the user flow, I performed usability testing with four users keeping in mind the defined user scenario.</p>
            <p>The main goal for the usability test was to evaluate if the app allowed users to find information about an authentic local experience at his/her vacation travel destination.</p>
            <h3>User tasks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Describe what the app is for</li>
                <li>Search a destination and apply filters</li>
                <li>Send a poll</li>
                <li>Respond to a fellow traveler’s poll </li>
                <li>Review received poll responses</li>
                <li class="extra-space">Add poll responses to a trip</li>

                            <li>Users were willing to contribute to the community by submitting a response to a poll and thought it was a simple step</li>
                            <li>Users liked the ability to add information found on the app to a specific trip</li>
                            <li>The search could be more sophisticated to accommodate advanced users</li>

                            <li>Refining language around benefits for creating an account before submitting a poll could help justify burden and incentivize account creation</li>
