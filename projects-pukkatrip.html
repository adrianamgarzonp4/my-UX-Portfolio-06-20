                <h2>Project overview</h2>
                <h3>Summary:</h3>
                <p>Through qualitative and quantitative user research, I discovered that travelers have a difficult time finding information about local experiences available at their desired destinations. This reality causes them to miss authentic experiences and to waste time and money once they are at their destination.</p>
                <p>PukkaTrip is a travel app prototype designed to alleviate the described pain point by helping travelers discover authentic local experiences.</p>
                <p>TL;DR - <span><a href="http://">Take a look at this case study storyboard here.</a></span></p>
                <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Uncover travelers’ pain points in their trip planning process (when traveling for vacation)</li>
                    <li>Implement a user-centered design methodology to prototype a mobile travel app that addresses those pain points</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>My Role & Responsibilities: </h3>
                <p>Sole UX and UI designer</p>
                <h3>Timeline: </h3>
                <p>4 weeks</p>
                <h3>Tools:</h3>
                <p>Pen & paper, Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, Adobe XD, Miro & Procreate</p>
                <h3>Methodology:</h3>
                <p>I approached this problem from a place of curiosity. That curiosity turned into empathy as I interviewed users. Once I understood their main pain points, I narrowed the scope of the problem by defining a user persona and scenario. As a next step, I ideated potential solutions, prioritized, designed, and tested the user flow and visual design a couple of times. Based on the user feedback, I revised my wireframes and prototyped a minimum valuable product that addressed the users' pain points and stood out from the competition.</p>

            <p>To learn more about how travelers plan their trips, I performed 5 interviews and 23 surveys.</p>
            <h3>Questions asked:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When traveling for vacation, what are some of the reasons why you do it?</li>
                <li>How do you go about planning a trip?</li>
                <li>What is the most time-consuming part about planning a vacation trip?</li>
                <li>What are the most time-consuming activities at your destination?</li>

            <p>Finding a user insight was my first step to begin defining the problem space and give the user a face and a voice. This user insight summarizes opinions given by multiple people during the user research phase.</p>

            <p>With a good understanding of the persona, his needs and goals, and the fact that the competitors are not addressing the user needs, I proceeded to define a “How Might We” statement to guide the ideation process.</p>

            <h3>Ideation and Prioritization</h3>
            <p>With the persona created in mind, the ideation process begins.</p>
            <p>I used the "I like, I wish, What if" method to generate ideas aimed to solve the pain points of this user persona. His goals, habits, must-haves, frustrations, and personality are at the forefront of ideation.</p>
            <p>As a next step, I used a prioritization matrix to identify what ideas could potentially become features based on users' satisfaction and their viability/feasibility for PukkaTrip as a company.</p>
            <div class="grey-box">
                <img src="" alt="Adriana pointing at post-its on the wall">
                <h4>I like...</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Having access to my travel info on my phone and offline</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>I wish...</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I could connect with locals when I’m planning my trip</li>
                    <li>I could always get information that is up to date</li>
                    <li>I could save and revisit information about local activities that I want to do at my destination</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What if...</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I could poll locals about their favorite activities, restaurants, and breweries.</li>
                    <li>Responding to questions other travelers have about the area where I live, would give me some sort of benefit</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Prioritization of the features that came out of the ideation phase took a couple of iterations. I focused on features that were key as they directly allow the user to accomplish his goal. By limiting the number of features, I came up with a minimum valuable product.</p>

                <img src="" alt="Feature prioritization matrix focused on higher desirability and higher viability">

            <div class="grey-box">
                <h4>A challenge</h4>
                <p>At this point in the ideation process, I realized that integrating a poll feature that allows users to post questions and receive individualized responses would address the user’s pain points and make it stand out from competitors.</p>
                <p>However, a poll feature requires users to engage with the app by responding to other travelers’ polls, which makes the functionality sustainable and keeps the information authentic. Answering to other users' questions is a big ask that could deter some potential users from using the app.</p>
                <p>To move forward, I took a close look at the user persona and concluded that a poll feature would be well adopted by my user based on the following assumptions.</p>
                <h5>Assumptions</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user is a traveler who plans ahead and enjoys discovering and connecting with others</li>
                    <li>The user is willing to take extra steps to make sure he gets the information he needs to maximize his travel experience</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Important considerations for the adoption of the poll feature</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The user will be shown previous poll responses and other users’ contributions before committing to submit a poll</li>
                    <li>After sending a poll the user will be invited to, not required to, reply to a fellow traveler's poll</li>
                    <li>Replying to a poll has to be as effortless as possible. Language in the request should be carefully crafted to incentivize its use and boost user’s buy-in</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>User flow diagram</h3>
            <p>Once I decided to commit to including a poll feature, I began defining the user flow.</p>
            <h4>Goals</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining a critical path that allowed the user to browse through locals’ and travelers’ recommendations</li>
                <li>Allowing the user to submit a poll to get current and individualized answers to his questions and review poll responses</li>
                <li>Figuring out a way to keep the community sustainable by encouraging users to provide authentic information to other users</li>
                <li>Reducing friction at entry-point
                    <p><em>Note:</em>this user flow incorporates the task of creating an account to submit a poll. Although it can be off-putting for some users, we are assuming that our user does most of his planning on his own and way in advance. Therefore, he is used to creating accounts to manage and keep track of the information he needs for his trip. There will be wording clarifying the convenience of creating an account on the screen.</p>
